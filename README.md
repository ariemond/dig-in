Dig In is an app that will make the ‘private chef experience’ more accessible for diners, while also creating a platform for chefs to pick up extra work easily. The diner will input their location and date, and will then be connected to chefs that meet their requirements. They will be able to message them directly to plan their meal in advance.

I wanted to create an alternative option to take-out and bring the restaurant experience to people’s homes, making it more exciting to *STAY IN!*.
For diners, you currently have to book a private chef weeks in advance, have a minimum amount of diners, and it is very expensive. Dig In will allow them to book a chef up to a day before, for however many diners they want, and will be charged based on what the chef has set their wage to be (+ cost of ingredients). For chefs that have been laid off or have had their hours cut due to the pandemic, this would allow them to easily update their availability and pick up extra work whenever they want. 

This is a React app, and I used Firebase for authentication and as my database.  As well as Node, Express and Stripe for payments.
